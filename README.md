This Code does just takes your Database URl and uses prisma db pull commnad and just runs on the localhost:5555.

This is just for if we need to use some small changes in our code ,we do not prefer to write queries,edit collections.

Prisma Cloud has a very simplicity in doing thid task.So this is just a side project which helps me in doing this.
